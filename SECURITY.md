# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep `nicobleiler/php-passphrase` and its users safe.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are provided on a best-effort basis for:

- The latest stable release line
- The default development branch (`dev`) when a fix has not yet been released

Older versions may not receive security updates.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities in public issues or pull requests.

Instead, report privately using one of these options:

1. **Preferred:** GitHub Security Advisories ("Report a vulnerability")
2. If private advisories are unavailable, contact the maintainer directly through a private channel

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof of concept if possible)
- Affected version(s)
- Any suggested mitigation or patch

## Response process

- We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible
- We will investigate, validate impact, and work on a fix
- We will coordinate disclosure timing with the reporter when feasible
- We will publish a fix and release notes once remediation is available

## Disclosure expectations

Please allow reasonable time to investigate and remediate before public disclosure.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and security research.
